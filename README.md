# SurferAPI
This is a Surfer readme file for our Github repository.The project will focus on learning Spring framework.
We build an API which will allow users (surfers) to post, read, 
update and comment/like all info about three known surf beaches,so they can know what 
conditions are in these beaches such as: wave's hight, water temperature, shark attacks etc.
## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to learn spring framework, maven and create API.
Postman will be used as a test tool. 
To take in consideration both happy flows as well as unhappy flows.
